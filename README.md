ADAFILM. Series finder
Hey there! This is my project for the final evaluation of Adalab's second module. It's a series finder. What you can do here is search for different series by name, save them as favourites, remove them when you no longer need them, and have them storaged in local storage.

Main goal
The main goal for this project was to apply our recently acquired JavaScript knowledge and combine it with what we learnt in Adalab's first module; HTML and CSS.

Any questions or comments?
Please do let me know! :)
